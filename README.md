# Food-Store

The Food Store is a Web App and CMS running PHP/Apache/MySQL server-side, and plain HTML/CSS client-side.
It's a customer-facing online shopping experience that allows for selecting items for purchase, adding to shopping cart, and of course, checking out. 

Also there is an administrative-facing web interface, allowing store managers to add new products and modify existing ones, monitor stock levels, and process customer orders.

Customer-side should be located at localhost/Food-Store.

Admin-should be at localhost/Food-Store/admin/admin.php.

It uses a mySQL database which allows for complex tasks like search functionality, storing and retrieving binary data, handling transactions, implementing shopping carts, and generating downloadable Excel reports.

If there is any interest I could do a database dump, and upload the sql files too.
